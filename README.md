![ðŸš€ Deploy website on push](https://github.com/henrikwilhelmsen/henrikwilhelmsen.com/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

My personal portfolio [website](https://henrikwilhelmsen.com), built with [pico](https://picocss.com/)

## Development

Requires [sass](https://sass-lang.com/install)

Run sass with --watch to keep css updated while working:

```shell
sass source/scss/main.scss source/css/main.css --watch
```

All pushes to main are automatically built and uploaded to the website ftp server.
